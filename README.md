# PyBer_Analysis

## A summary of the pyber ride sharing data that comapres the total weekly fares each city type.

## Data included:
Included were two CSV files. One of just city data and one of just ride data.

## Data organization

Both data sets were merged into one data set refered to as the "pyber_data_df". 
The merged Pyber Dataframe had the currency columns formatted to include a "$" symbol. 
Summary data was then found using both the merged dataframe and the individual dataframes when needed.

## Findings
Based on the findings we can conclude that Urban areas have a significantly higher total number of rides.
Total Rides for each city type are as follows

 *Rural: 125
 Suburban: 625
 Urban: 1625

A similar pattern follows with the amount of drivers for each city type.
Rural areas have much less than Urban and Suburban areas.
Total Drivers are as follows:

*Rural: 78
Suburban: 490
Urban: 2405

However, due to the scarcity of drivers in Rural areas it does seem
that the average fare per driver is much huger than in Urban and Suburban areas.

Average fare per driver(rounded up to the nearest dollar. A more accurate number can be found in the analysis.)

*Rural:       $55
Suburban:    $40
Urban:       $17

Below is a visualized multi-line chart of the findings.
